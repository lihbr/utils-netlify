## About

`@lihbr/utils-netlify.*` are helpers I use across my [Netlify](https://netlify.com) projects. To achieve that purpose they are designed to be as agnostic as possible, although being quite opinionated.

> :warning: Those packages just got migrated to actual packages and are still pre-major version (`v1.x.x`). I'll most likely refactor them before releasing a first major and allow myself to publish breaking changes while doing so, therefore if you want to use them as is I highly recommend watching out when upgrading their versions.
>
> Also feel free to inspire from them, [submit feedback or questions](https://github.com/lihbr/utils-netlify/issues/new), or fork this repository~
